rompar
======

Masked ROM optical data extraction tool.

Latest version:

  https://github.com/AdamLaurie/rompar

Note that this initial version is very much a quick-and-dirty 'see if this method is useful'
kind of tool. If it is, hopefully it will evolve into something pretty and elegant!

  usage: rompar.py <IMAGE> <BITS PER GROUP> <ROWS PER GROUP> [GRID FILE]

Hit 'h' when the image has focus to produce some keystroke help in the calling window.

For a walked through example, read this:

Enjoy!
